# Damien Meere - BT Ireland
### Practical Python and Data-Centric Development Milestone Project- Code Institute

This project website will highlight my capability to employ the various tools illustrated throughout the Practical Python and Data-Centric Development section of the Code Institute 
programme. 

This project will present a Training course booking site, that will enable trainees to view what courses are currently planned, and what courses have been complete. In 
relation to the courses that are planned, the trainee will be able to view the uptake level and make a booking. For courses that have been complete, the trainee can provide feedback 
for future trainees to identify the most popular courses.

The site will also facilitate the trainer in Creating, Viewing, Editing and Deleting new courses, viewing feedback from previous courses, and viewing a dashboard to see some pertinant
statistics about the training programmes.

No User Authentication will be incorporated into this project, as this is considers beyond the scope of this section of the course. Rather there will be an anonymous Trainer and trainee
area within the site.

## Future-Features
Authentication, Authorisation and Accounting: In the next iteration of this project (see [Internal Deployment](#Internal-Deployment)) user Authentication will be required, utilising internal BT infrastructure.

A [Training Dashboard](https://damien-meere.github.io/interactive_frontend_milestone/) was developed in a previous milestone project. The next step in the evolution of this tool will be to interconnect the two tools, and utilise the dashboard to interogate the dateset generate through the continued use of this tool by both Trainers and Trainees within BT. 

Another useful feature will be to faciliate ongoing easy to understand feedback for both the Trainers and Trainees. Each course will be able to determine the popularity/success of a progamme by enable using to gia ve course an Upvote or a Downvote.This feedback will enable trainees to quickly ascertain how other trainees have felt about a programme before proceeding to enroll.

## Testing



All CSS, HTML and Javascript files were passed through code validators. The [CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/) & [HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org)
checked the markup validity of Web documents against the w3c standards. the [JSHint](https://jshint.com/) utility was used to check for errors and potential problems in the
JavaScript code.

All links on each page were individually tested to ensure they navigated to the requisite page.

This site was tested across multiple browsers (Chrome, Safari, Firefox), and on multiple devices (Samsung Galaxy S8/S9/S10, Samsung Galaxy Tab, Apple iPad, iPhone 6/7/8)
to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. As detailed in the next section, the display of charts is somewhat unresponsive on smaller screens, and the current iteration
is suited to desktop presentation.

## Deployment
Site to be hosted on the Heroku Platform (Include all pertinant links here)

This site is hosted using GitHub pages, deployed directly from the master branch. The deployed site will update automatically upon new commits to the master branch.
In order for the site to deploy correctly on GitHub pages, the landing page is named `index.html`, and the current live site can be accessed [HERE](https://damien-meere.github.io/interactive_frontend_milestone/).

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into the editor of your choice by pasting `git clone https://github.com/damien-meere/interactive_frontend_milestone.git` into your terminal.
To cut ties with this GitHub repository, type `git remote rm origin` into the terminal.

You can also Clone this Repository to GitHub Desktop, by navigating to the [main page](https://github.com/damien-meere/interactive_frontend_milestone) of the repository on GitHub, under the repository
name, click Clone or download. Click Open in Desktop to clone the repository and open it in GitHub Desktop. Click Choose... and, using Windows Explorer, navigate to a local path where you
want to clone the repository. For more information you can review the [GitHub site](https://help.github.com/en/articles/cloning-a-repository#cloning-a-repository-to-github-desktop).

## Internal-Deployment
Use within BT - This is a test portal which I aim to use to faciliate booking to courses and training sessions within BT. This protal will be deployed internally within the 
company's Intranet, with the code being housed within internal infrastructure. Using this portal, training managers will be able to circulate information relating to upcoming 
courses, and faciliate more effective and efficient administration of these training programmes. As detailed in the [Future Features](#Future-Features) section, the next iteration 
will require integration within internal BT AAA infrastructure to ensure adequate security.
